# Project: Real-Time Weather Data Collection, Validation, and Storage in InfluxDB
Objective:
Develop a Python-based system that fetches real-time weather data for a user's current location,
validates and cleans the data, and stores it in InfluxDB. This system will also include optional
visualization, automation, and monitoring features.
1. Fetching Real-Time Weather Data
• API Integration: Utilize a weather API, such as OpenWeatherMap, to fetch real-time
weather data.
• Key Data Points: Retrieve essential metrics, including temperature, humidity, wind speed,
and wind direction.
2. Data Validation
• Range Validation:
• Temperature: Ensure the temperature falls within the range of -100°C to 60°C.
• Humidity: Validate that humidity values are between 0% and 100%.
• Wind Speed: Check that wind speed is within 0 to 200 km/h.
• Missing Data Handling:
• Implement strategies to manage missing data, such as logging the incident,
imputing with an average value, or discarding the entry.
• Optional: Use a data validation library, like Pydantic, to enforce data schemas and
constraints.
3. Data Cleaning and Manipulation
• Outlier Detection: Identify and handle outliers within the dataset. Perform statistical
calculations (mean, average, max, etc.) to understand data distributions.
• Temperature Conversion: Convert the temperature data from Kelvin (if applicable) to
Celsius.
• Wind Data Aggregation: Combine wind speed and direction into a more user-friendly
format.
• Derived Metrics: Optionally, calculate and add additional fields, such as the "feels like"
temperature.
4. Storing Data in InfluxDB
• InfluxDB Setup: Establish an InfluxDB instance to store time-series weather data.
• Data Ingestion: Write the cleaned and validated data into InfluxDB. Organize it with
appropriate measurements and tags, including location and timestamp.
5. Optional: Data Visualization
• Visualization Tools: Use libraries like Plotly, Matplotlib, or others to visualize the stored
weather data.
• Dashboard Creation: Develop interactive visualizations to explore trends in temperature,
humidity, and wind conditions.
6. Automation and Monitoring
• Scheduled Data Fetching:
• Automate the data fetching process using tools like Kafka, Cron jobs, or Apache
Airflow to ensure periodic updates.
• Monitoring and Alerts:
• Implement a monitoring system to track the success of data fetches and handle
errors or exceptions.
• Optionally, set up alerts for conditions such as extreme temperatures or high wind
speeds.
